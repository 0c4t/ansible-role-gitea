# Ansible role for provisioning gitea instance
The purpose of this role is to configure and manage [gitea](https://gitea.io) instance.

This role made for use with my private gitea server. 

Use on your own risk, because there are no docs yet.

## How to install?
```bash
ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/grebokra/ansible-role-gitea -p <roles directory>
```
